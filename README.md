# Job Portal App

The Job Portal App is a cross-platform application built using Dart/Flutter and Firebase Cloud Database that enables users to apply for available jobs. Users can create an account, sign up and login, explore job listings, view job descriptions, and apply for positions that match their skills and interests.

## Features:

User Registration and Login: The Job Portal app provides a simple and secure user registration and login system using Firebase Authentication. Users can create an account, sign up, and login to access their dashboard.

Job List: Users can view available jobs, with each job color-coded based on its application deadline.

Job Details: The app displays job details such as job description, required skills, job responsibilities, and other relevant information.

Apply for Jobs: Users can apply for jobs that match their skills and interests

Applied Jobs: Users can view the list of jobs for which they have applied.

## Admin Features:
Create New Jobs: Admins can create new job listings by filling out a form with job details, such as job title, company, location, job description, and application deadline.

View Applicants: Admins can view a list of all job applications for each job listing. This feature enables admins to manage applications more efficiently and make informed hiring decisions.

Archive Jobs: Admins can archive job listings that are no longer. Archiving a job listing removes it from the list of available jobs.
